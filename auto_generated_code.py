# Auto-generated code for issue CAL-4
# Prompt: Write a Python function `multiply(numbers: list)` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns their product.  Handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric values by raising a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.  Ensure this function integrates seamlessly with an existing "calculator main program" (assume its structure is already defined).
print('Hello from automation!')
