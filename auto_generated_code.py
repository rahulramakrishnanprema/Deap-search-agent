# Auto-generated code for issue CAL-2
# Prompt: Write a Python function `add(numbers: list)` that calculates the sum of a list of numbers.  The function must handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values in the list) by raising a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.  Assume an existing `calculator` program; integrate this `add` function into that program.  The output should show the function's integration within the calculator's functionality.
print('Hello from automation!')
